<!-- Use append() to dynamically add div elements whose height and width will be determined by the number of cells the user wants (for loop should be able to handle this) -->
<!-- alert (doesn't actually have to be an alert, I can just show/hide a nice input container) + form combination? with val() to read the users input value. On submit call the draw helper function to redraw the canvas. also hide the input box again -->
